## Weclome to microshell!

This is a minimalist version of bash.
It can executes command one at a time, including commands with ';' or '|' operators.
External commands require the entire path (example: '/bin/ls' needs to be type in order to use ls).

This is the code I submitted during an exam of 42 school.
